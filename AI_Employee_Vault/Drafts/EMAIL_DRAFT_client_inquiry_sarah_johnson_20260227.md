Hi Sarah,

Thank you for the positive feedback — we're equally excited to move this forward with your team. Happy to address your questions:

**1. Timeline for the first milestone**
Following project kickoff, we target delivery of the first milestone within **2–3 weeks**. This covers initial workflow mapping, environment setup, and the first automated process in production. A detailed project schedule will be shared at the kickoff call for your team's review.

**2. Onboarding process**
Our onboarding runs in four stages:
- **Week 1:** Kickoff call + requirements deep-dive with your team
- **Week 1–2:** Environment configuration and integration setup
- **Week 2–3:** Team walkthrough, hands-on training sessions, documentation handover
- **Week 3+:** Go-live support and a 2-week hypercare period

We keep it lightweight — typically 2–3 hours of your team's time in week 1, then minimal involvement as we build.

**3. Payment terms — Net-30**
Absolutely, we can accommodate **Net-30 payment terms**. That aligns with our standard billing schedule, so no issue at all.

Please let us know if you have any other questions. Looking forward to hearing your decision and getting started!

Best regards,
