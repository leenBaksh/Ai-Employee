## Post Content

I built a fully autonomous AI Employee in 48 hours. It reads my emails, replies to clients, posts on LinkedIn, creates invoices in my ERP, and sends me a CEO briefing every Monday morning.

No clicking. No copy-paste. Just a markdown vault and Claude Code.

Here's a demo of all 4 tiers in action 👇

The hardest part wasn't the AI — it was the architecture. How do you make an agent that works 24/7 without constantly asking for help?

Our answer: a vault-centric design where every task is a markdown file. Watchers write tasks in. Claude reasons and acts. MCP servers execute. Humans approve anything sensitive.

The numbers are wild:
→ Human FTE: 2,000 hrs/year at ~$5/task
→ AI Employee: 8,760 hrs/year at ~$0.25/task

That's an 85% cost reduction per task — the number where CEOs stop asking questions.

Built with Claude Code + Obsidian + Python + MCP servers. Full source on GitHub.
