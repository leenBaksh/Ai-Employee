## Email Content

Hi,

Thank you for sending over the proposal last week. We've reviewed it internally and the team is very excited about the automation possibilities.

A few questions before we move forward:

1. Can you walk us through the timeline for the first milestone?
2. What does the onboarding process look like for our team?
3. Is there flexibility on the payment terms — we'd prefer net-30 instead of net-14.

We're aiming to make a decision by end of this week, so a quick reply would be appreciated.

Best,
Sarah Johnson
Head of Operations, TechStartup.io
