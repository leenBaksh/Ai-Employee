# Action Required: Confirm Facebook Business Email

## What Needs to Happen

Facebook sent an email asking you to **confirm the business email address** for your "AI Employee" Facebook Business account.

**Email received:** Mon, 23 Feb 2026
**From:** Facebook <notification@facebookmail.com>
**Subject:** Confirm your business email address

**Snippet:** _"Please click the link below to confirm that your email address for AI Employee should be updated to wdigital085@gmail.com"_

## Required Action

1. Open Gmail at wdigital085@gmail.com
2. Find the email from Facebook with subject "Confirm your business email address"
3. Click the confirmation link inside the email

This cannot be done autonomously — it requires clicking a verification link in Gmail.

## Why This Matters

Without confirming the email, the Facebook Business Manager account for "AI Employee" may have limited functionality (posting, ads, etc. may be restricted).
