## Post Content

We just built a fully autonomous AI Employee in 48 hours. Here's what surprised us most.

Not the technology — that part was expected. What surprised us was how quickly it started handling *real* work.

Within the first day, our AI Employee was:
→ Reading and triaging our Gmail inbox
→ Drafting client replies (with approval gates before sending)
→ Generating invoices and tracking payments
→ Posting scheduled content across social channels
→ Waking itself up each morning with a CEO briefing

The system we built runs on a simple loop: **Sense → Decide → Act → Log → Escalate.**

Everything sensitive — emails to clients, payments, social posts — gets routed to a human approval queue before execution. The AI does the thinking and drafting. The human stays in control of the final action.

What we learned:
1. Approval-first design isn't a limitation — it's what makes AI agents actually usable in business
2. An Obsidian vault makes a surprisingly good "brain" for an AI employee
3. The hardest part isn't the AI — it's defining clear rules for what it can and can't do autonomously

The future of work isn't AI replacing employees. It's AI handling the repetitive 80% so your team can focus on the 20% that actually needs human judgment.

What would YOUR ideal AI Employee handle first?
