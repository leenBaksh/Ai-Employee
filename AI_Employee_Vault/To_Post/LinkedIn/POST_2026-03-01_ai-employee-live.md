## Post Content

After weeks of building, our AI Employee is fully operational. 🤖

Here's what it can do autonomously:
→ Monitor Gmail and flag important emails
→ Receive and triage WhatsApp Business messages
→ Draft replies and wait for human approval before sending
→ Generate invoices and weekly CEO briefings
→ Post to social media — after approval
→ Run 24/7 with health monitoring and cloud sync

The key design principle: **human-in-the-loop for every external action.**

The AI drafts. You approve. Nothing goes out without your sign-off.

Built with Claude Code + Playwright automation + a file-based vault that doubles as an Obsidian dashboard.

What's the one task you'd want an AI Employee to handle first?
