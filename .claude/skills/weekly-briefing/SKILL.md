# Weekly Briefing — AI Employee Skill

Generate the Monday Morning CEO Briefing from vault data.

## Step 1: Read All Context

```bash
cat AI_Employee_Vault/Business_Goals.md
cat AI_Employee_Vault/Accounting/Current_Month.md
cat AI_Employee_Vault/Accounting/Rates.md
ls AI_Employee_Vault/Done/
ls AI_Employee_Vault/Logs/
```

## Step 2: Analyze This Week's Activity

**From `/Done/` folder:** Count and categorize completed tasks this week.

**From `/Logs/` files:** Parse JSON entries for this week. Count:
- Emails processed
- LinkedIn posts published
- Invoices created
- Approvals granted/rejected
- Alerts triggered

**From `/Accounting/Current_Month.md`:** Extract:
- Total income MTD
- Total expenses MTD
- Revenue vs monthly goal

## Step 3: Identify Bottlenecks

Check for tasks that took > 2 days:
- Look in `/Needs_Action/` for items with old `received:` dates
- Check `/Pending_Approval/` for items waiting > 24 hours
- Check for SLA breach alerts in logs

## Step 4: Subscription Audit

Per `Business_Goals.md` Subscription Audit Rules — flag any:
- Recurring transactions with no corresponding usage
- Costs increased > 20%
- Duplicate tools

## Step 5: Write the Briefing

Save to `/Briefings/<YYYY-MM-DD>_Monday_Briefing.md`:

```markdown
